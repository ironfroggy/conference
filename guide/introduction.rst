Introduction
=============

Putting on a community event - no matter how small, or how large, can be a
daunting task. It involves a delicate series of balancing acts - financial,
social, theme and scope. It is also possibly one of the most rewarding things
you may ever do.

Make no mistake though - it is an investment, an investment of your time, money
and other resources which is fraut with pitfalls. When though, at the end of
your event, and people come up to you and shake you and your volunteers' hands,
pat you on the back and thank you you will know it was worth it.

We hope, by making this guide that you can navigate the pitfalls and mistakes
that many of us have made. We hope to provide to you enough resources and pointers
so that you can hit the ground running and put on yet another amazing event for
the community.

Picking your event
------------------

This may sound odd; but before you go much further, you need to think about
what kind of event you wish to put on. Are you thinking of going small - a single
track with short talks, spanning maybe one or two days,
